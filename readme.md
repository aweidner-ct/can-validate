# Can Validate

A plugin for CanJS that wraps any validation library to `can.validate`. Can.Validate doesn't do any validation of it's own but instead provides some abstraction to your library of choice which is added using a shim.

The plugin also includes a plugin for `can.Map.define` that can be used to automatically check values as they are set to the property.

Don't have a library of choice? Can.Validate ships with a shim for CanJS Validations and [ValidateJS](http://validatejs.org/).

The docs cover the following topics:

- can.validate core
- can.Map.validate plugin
- The CanJS Validations library
- Available Shims
- Creating your own shim
